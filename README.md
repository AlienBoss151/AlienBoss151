THE PROJECT JOURNEY OF CARLOS EXCHANGE & TRIBOWL NETWORK
The Project Owner
My name is Onwuka Somtochukwu, also known as Lord Carlos, AlienBoss, or Owl Himself. I am the founder and owner of the Tribowl Network. Hailing from Enugu State, Nigeria, I have a passion for creating unique and challenging projects. My journey began in 2021 with CarlosExchange, and I have since expanded my vision to establish a larger model aimed at providing financial independence and accessibility to money creation for the majority.

Despite the challenges and lack of resources, I have persevered, driven by the belief that money, like cryptocurrency, is created by man. This belief has fueled my ambition to develop the Tribowl Network, a project that I have been working on since mid-2022. With the help of AI tools like Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, and DeepAI, I have dedicated over a year and eight months to this project, often isolating myself from social media to focus on my work.

Project Components
Tribowl Network: The core platform for currency creation and network management.
Tikbot: A versatile tool for creating, earning, and deploying applications.
OwlPay: A standalone online banking system designed for seamless transactions.
CarlosExchange: A peer-to-peer marketplace facilitating secure and efficient trades.
Tribowl-Wallet: A Web3 wallet enabling interactions with various cryptocurrencies.
TikCoin (Owl): The primary currency used within the Tribowl Network.
